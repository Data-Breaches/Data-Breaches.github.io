and promptly launched an investigation into the nature and scope of the incident, the information that may have
been improperly accessed, and the identities of the impacted individuals. Avid also took steps to secure the email
accounts. The investigation determined a rule to forward all incoming messages to an unauthorized email account
was established on an employee’s account from October 8, 2018 to October 12, 2018. Avid then began an extensive
programmatic and manual review of the impacted account to determine if any sensitive data was contained in the
account. Avid began notifying individuals on or around June 5, 2019, while this data review was underway. On August
16, 2019, we completed the process of identifying individuals who may have had personal information accessible in
the account. We recently concluded a thorough, manual review of our records to identify contact information for the
remaining individuals with information accessible within the account.

On or about November 9, 2018, we were alerted to suspicious activity regarding an employee’s business e-mail
account. We immediately began investigating this activity and subsequently determined that an unauthorized third
party had illegally gained access to the employee’s business e-mail account on July 21, 2018. The hacker also gained
access to a second employee’s email account. The hacker was able to view the contents of both e-mail accounts and
send “spear-phishing” e-mails to others. A “spear-phishing” e-mail is a message that appears to be from someone the
recipient knows and trusts, but it is actually sent by a different person trying to illegally obtain access to the recipient’s
computer system, e-mail accounts, or personal information. We have seen no evidence of this hack extending outside

On Oct 24, 2014, we discovered that a third party obtained access to our users’ emails and
“hashed’ passwords. That means that the passwords were encrypted in such a way that it is nearly impossible
for anyone, even us, to read it. However, on Oct 24, 2017, a security researcher informed us of a file containing
emails and plaintext passwords which claims the data had come from us (Armor Games) and another company
(Coupon Mom). We are investigating whether we are the true source of the breach, since the number of leaked
emails/passwords is far less than the number of emails breached on either our system or Coupon Mom’s
system in 2013. Our users’ passwords were hashed (this makes it unlikely that they could extract plaintext
passwords from our data), and some users are reporting that their passwords were included in this breach
though they have never used either site. As we investigate the source of the data in this file, we are taking the
precautionary measure of treating this as a data breach of our own users.

Around March 21, 2013 we were notified by the credit card processing vendor that Anasazi was identified as the “common point of purchase” for a number of credit cards involved in fraudulent transactions with other merchants. The notice of common point of purchase was simply to alert Anasazi that it, perhaps with other merchants, was a merchant common to subsequent suspected fraudulent uses of payment cards used at our facility. In response to the notice, we quickly locked down our computer network and all computer systems and engaged forensic investigators, who analyzed all aspects of our data systems to determine whether credit card information was in fact accessed without authorization. The forensic experts uncovered evidence that Anasazi was the target of cyberattackers seeking to access parts of our internal network and data systems. The forensic experts found evidence that as early as June 18, 2012 the cyber-attackers installed malware apparently designed to perform certain functions, including eventually transmitting credit card data outside the secure network. While the forensic experts found no actual evidence that credit card information was in fact transmitted to the attackers, the forensic experts have concluded that the malware discovered on the Anasazi systems is consistent with that typically used to gather and transmit sensitive credit card data. Out of an abundance of caution, we are providing this notice to you even in the absence of hard evidence that your credit card data was in fact taken by the attackers.

On August 17, 2018, we were notified by law enforcement that they suspected certain of A&A’s information may
have been compromised by unknown cyber attackers. Upon receiving this notification, we immediately engaged
with several firms, including a leading computer forensic firm, to conduct a forensic investigation into the matter.
As a result of that investigation, we discovered that unauthorized code was placed on our website that may have
been capable of capturing certain information entered on the website during the checkout process. Our forensic
investigation further revealed that the cyber attackers also may have been able to acquire data out of our customer
database. Based on our investigation to date, it appears that information entered on our website may have been
exposed at various points in time, including from August 15, 2017 to January 4, 2019. Importantly, the unauthorized
code identified during our forensic investigation has been removed.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
We detected recent suspicious website activity. Upon investigation, we discovered that some person or automated robot was attempting to log in to online Bed Bath & Beyond accounts by guessing commonly used passwords or by obtaining usernames and passwords from another source outside Bed Bath & Beyond. It may be that whoever made these attempts had obtained user names and passwords from another site relying on their knowledge that many people use the same password on multiple sites. It does appear that one of these efforts was succcessful in logging in to your Bed Bath & Beyond online account very recently with a password that was able to be guessed or obrained from some
source likely outside of Bed Bath & Beyond. At this time, we have no reason to believe that there was any effort made to place any unauthorized orders on your Bed Bath & Beyond account, that credit card could not have been used without entering the security code from the card itself. That security code is not stored on our website and therefore would not have been available on our website, even if someone entered your username and password. Moreover, only the card type, expiration date, and lat four digits of the card number would have been visible, which means it could not have been used to make unauthorized purchases elsewhere.

On February 13, 2019, BambooHR became aware of unauthorized access by an unidentified thirdparty to the TraxPayroll system. We determined that the unauthorized party was trying to change
employee direct deposit information, which we quickly isolated and fixed. We also shut-down the
means by which the unauthorized access occurred. It appears that the third party may have had access
to the TraxPayroll system as early as February 5, 2019, but the attempted inappropriate actions took
place between February 11-13, 2019. BambooHR then conducted a comprehensive review of all
unauthorized activity and determined that a report was accessed that may have allowed the third
party to view personal information of certain employees. It appears that the unauthorized party’s
purpose in accessing the TraxPayroll system was to divert payroll deposits into its own accounts, not
to collect personal information. While BambooHR is unable to determine whether your personal
information was retained, it was contained in the report that was accessed. Out of an abundance of
caution, BambooHR is notifying all individuals that may have been affected by this this unfortunate
event.

We discovered that an unauthorized third party obtained unlawful access to certain temporary data files on our website.
These temporary data files are used only to complete e-commerce transactions and are not otherwise retained by Bellacor.
The information accessed in the temporary files included customer name, address, phone number and encrypted credit card
information. The malicious code used by the unauthorized party was discovered and contained on July 26th, and we believe
it was injected by the unauthorized third party around June 7th. While our investigation is ongoing, we believe that in
certain limited circumstances the unauthorized third party was able to extract such information from the temporary data
files. Your recent purchase occurred during the time period when the unauthorized third party was attempting to obtain this
information about our customers. While we do not have evidence that your information was compromised, we are taking
precautionary measures to protect your financial security and alleviate concerns you may have.

On Friday January 19, 2018, a California College of Arts (the “College”) laptop used
by one of our employees was stolen out of the employee’s vehicle. The employee promptly reported the
theft to College staff and to local law enforcement. The College quickly began to investigate and take
steps to respond. The user’s passwords were changed to prevent access to the College’s computer
systems. The College also began to monitor for signs that the laptop was active to remotely wipe the
device. To date, the College has not seen any signs that laptop has connected to the internet. Since
learning of the theft, the College has been identifying and reviewing files that may have been contained
on the laptop at the time of the theft to determine what information may have been accessible on the
device. To date, we have no evidence of any actual or attempted misuse of information as a result of this

On November 3, 2015, Elephant Bar was alerted to a potential security incident by its card processor. Based upon an extensive forensic investigation, it appears that unauthorized individuals installed malicious software on our payment processing systems at certain restaurant locations designed to capture payment card information. These locations included 20 in California: Bakersfield, Burlingame, Campbell, Citrus Heights, Concord, Cupertino, Daly City, Downey, Dublin, Emeryville, Fremont, Fresno, Hayward, La Mirada, Lakewood, Montclair, Sacramento, San Marcos, Torrance and West Covina; three in Colorado: Colorado Springs, Lakewood and Greenwood Village; two in Arizona: Chandler and Peoria, and one each in Orlando, Florida, St. Louis, Missouri, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Henderson, Nevada. We believe the malware could have compromised payment card data – including name, payment card account number, card expiration date, and verification code – of customers who used a payment card at the affected locations.

On or around December 1, 2016, we received reports of suspicious activity
from our third party e-commerce partner. We immediately began to investigate these reports to
identify what happened and what information was impacted. Third-party computer forensic
investigators were retained to assist with the investigation into what happened and what data was
impacted. The investigation initially identified suspicious files on the system. In an abundance of
caution, all user passwords were reset as this incident was initially determined to impact only
name, address, email address, and encrypted passwords. Further investigation identified a
malicious code inserted into the e-commerce website. Upon identifying the malicious code,
Cuddl Duds and its partner quickly took steps to remove the code and prevent further
unauthorized access. A review of the code determined that it was capable of collecting
information provided by customers on the checkout page of Cuddl Duds.

To process these requests, DBO utilizes the records contained in the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority’s (FINRA) Central Registration Depository (CRD). Fields clearly designated as containing personal identifying information within the FINRA CRD are then redacted by DBO prior to its release. However, despite our efforts, DBO recently learned that, pursuant to one or more PRA requests, the personal identifying information of a number of registered investment advisers and broker-dealers was inadvertently disclosed to persons not authorized to receive such information.

contained certain protected information. As a precaution, the entire contents of the storage account was

Decron became aware of unusual activity in certain Decron email accounts. In
response, Decron worked with an outside forensics expert to investigate the nature and scope of the
activity. Through this investigation, Decron confirmed that certain email accounts were accessed
without authorization on April 28, 2019. Although the investigation was unable to determine whether
any information contained in email messages or file attachments stored in the email accounts was
actually accessed by an unauthorized actor, we cannot rule out whether that type of activity occurred.
In an abundance of caution, Decron performed a thorough review of the information contained within
the impacted email accounts, and on October 24, 2019, determined that your personal information was
potentially accessible by the unauthorized actor. Extra4 Variable Sentence- Tenant Language Extra4

For most hotels, there are two ways to make a reservation – directly with the hotel or indirectly through
third-party online booking websites (websites run by other companies that compare rooms and rates at
different hotels). For reservations that are made through online booking websites, many hotels use a
technology service provider to collect the reservation data from the online booking company and enter it
into the hotel’s property management system. On March 26, 2019, we were notified by the company that
provides that service to us and other hotel companies that it was conducting an investigation to determine
if there had been unauthorized access to its network. The service provider reported that it had hired a
cybersecurity firm to conduct an investigation. Since then Drury Hotels has worked closely with the service
provider to get updates on its investigation.

On or about July 28, 2017, Driscoll’s determined that some employees’ payroll log-in
credentials were compromised when the employees responded to a phishing email. Driscoll’s launched an
investigation and, with the help of a third-party forensic provider, later determined that some employees’ email
accounts had also been subject to unauthorized access as a result of the phishing email. The forensic
investigator then reviewed the contents of these email accounts to determine whether they contained any
sensitive personal information. On December 18, 2017, we confirmed that sensitive information was located in
one or more of the email accounts. On January 17, 2018, the forensic investigator completed the review of the
affected email accounts and provided Driscoll’s with a list of employees whose protected information was
contained within the email accounts. The unauthorized access may have occurred between July 17, 2017 and

On September 10, 2018, Wells Fargo informed us that our website handling our company’s online ticket
sales (https://ims.eplalimo.com) was a common point of purchase for some unauthorized credit card transactions
with other merchants and that there may have been a possible compromise of our website. We immediately began
an investigation with the assistance of a leading computer security firm. On September 13, 2018, the vendor that
we hired to manage and host our online reservations determined that a coding error by a developer had created
the potential for unauthorized access to payment card data stored on our website. Specifically, information you
provided during checkout including name, address, email address, payment card number, expiration date, and printed
card security code, was accessible to unauthorized parties. Based on our investigation, we believe the incident
only involved customers who bought or attempted to buy tickets on our website between December 9, 2016 and

On January 30, 2016, we discovered spam files on one of our data servers. We removed the
spam and immediately launched an investigation to determine the nature of the access and what data may have
been stored on that server. We also hired a third party forensic investigator to supplement our investigation. The
forensic investigation revealed that the spam spread to a second domain on the same server. That server contained
a file with your information which you provided to Empathia when you submitted a request for a credit check in
2003 or 2004. We have no evidence that your data was accessed by an unauthorized individual, and we are
not aware of any actual or attempted misuse of your information. What’s more, there is no indication the
unauthorized access was for any purpose other than using our servers to spread spam emails. However, we

On September 23, 2020, GGRC detected unusual activity in its network environment consistent with a ransomware incident. Ransomware incidents typically involve an unauthorized actor gaining access to an entity’s network and deploying malware that encrypts the entity’s files, making them inaccessible. The unauthorized actor then commonly demands a ransom payment in exchange for the key to decrypt the entity’s files. Once GGRC discovered this incident, GGRC disabled its network, secured its systems, immediately began an investigation, and worked to restore operations and data access from backups. GGRC also engaged a leading, independent computer forensics firm to determine what happened and whether sensitive information may have been accessed or acquired by an unknown actor during the incident. Based on preliminary findings of the computer forensics firm, it was determined on October 5, 2020, that certain information belonging to the individuals we serve was acquired by an unknown actor.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In response to email phishing targeting Guaranteed Rate employees and other
suspicious activity, we launched an investigation with the assistance of a leading outside computer
forensics expert. On or around September 13, 2017, we confirmed a limited number of company email
accounts were accessed by unknown actors as the result of these phishing attacks. We then began a
thorough review of the email accounts to identify individuals whose personal information was affected.
This process has been ongoing and we confirmed on or around January 7, 2018 the individuals impacted
and the types of personal information that were affected. Based on our investigation, we have reason to
believe that your personal information was viewed and/or downloaded by these unknown actors at some
time between June 9 and October 2, 2017.

During the afternoon of Memorial Day, Monday, May 27, 2019, Hannibal cecame aware that an unauthorized party accessed data stored on Hannibal's servers. A third party remotely took over our server, including the data on the server, and our website. This third party is currently asking Hannibal for money to release its control over the server, data and the website. A data breach in which the data is held for rensom is not the same as a ransomware attack. Ransomware generally restricts access to the data on infected machines until the ransom is paid. 
A data breach however is a security incident in which sensitive or confidential data is copied and stolen from the organization. At this point, Hannibal has not discovered any evidence that any data was removed from our servers or otherwise compromised.

during this time frame, we undertook a comprehensive review of all of the emails that were present in the relevant

On the late afternoon of Monday July 25, 2016, my car window was broken out and my briefcase was stolen. In that briefcase was an external hard drive containing two different types of data. First, all office patient records were backed up on the drive, including social security numbers, driver’s license numbers, phone numbers, date of birth, physical and email addresses and health insurance information. NO passwords or user names appear in these records. No complete credit card information or bank account information was stored on this drive (only the last four digits of the most recent card used is stored). As a result, your personal information is now potentially accessible to unauthorized individuals. However, the risk of accessibility is extremely low because the data in its format is unreadable. In consulting with my dental soft-ware experts, they assure me it would be incredibly difficult and unlikely for anyone to access your records. However, since the data is not encrypted, I am required by law to notify you.  Secondly, pictures of patient cases (teeth only, no faces) that included patient first and last names and phone numbers were saved on the drive. These files of pictures are stored in jpeg format and can be opened easily.

To give you the context, we use software provided by a third party vendor, Aptos Inc., to process Nononsense.com orders. Aptos is a highly experienced provider of retail technology and has a large universe of well-known brand customers. As has become increasingly common on the web in recent years, there was an intrusion into a portion of Aptos’ systems that holds payment card data and certain other customer information for online orders placed on Nononsense.com. Specifically, this intrusion compromised the Aptos digital commerce solution we and many other brands use, and those responsible gained access to information, including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and some payment card information as customers made transactions on Aptos’ systems. They also gained access to historical payment card data for cards no longer in use.

Although the investigation identified the operation of malware designed to access payment card data from cards used in person on system at our restaurants and food and beverage outlets, the end-to-end encryption technology on point-of-sale terminals, which makes card 
data unreadable, was working as designed and prevented the malware from accessing payment card data when cards were used on these encryption devices. Besides the encryption devices used to process payment cards, our restaurants and food and beverage outlets also have order-entry system with a card reader attached for waitstaff to enter kitchen and bar orders and to swipe landry's select club reward cards. in rare circumstances, it appears waitstaff may have mistakenly swiped payment cards on the order-entry systems.

Loungefly appears to have experienced an incident in which unauthorized code was placed
on the portion of our computer network that processes payment card transactions for the Loungefly online store
at www.loungefly.com. In response, we took immediate steps to secure the affected part of our network,
including removing the unauthorized code. Following the discovery of the code, an investigation also was
commenced to understand the nature and scope of the incident. The investigation concluded on April 3, 2019.
At this time, we believe that we will not ever be able to confirm that any payment card information was in fact
acquired by an unauthorized individual as a result of the incident. However, we also cannot rule out the
possibility that data associated with less than 3,600 payment cards used in transactions between September 19
and December 17, 2018 may have been affected. We have reported the matter to law enforcement, but this
notice has not been delayed because of law enforcement investigation.

Through these investigations, PaperlessPay confirmed that an unknown person (the “Hacker”)
on February 18, 2020 accessed PaperlessPay’s database where MMC employees’ data was
stored. The available evidence has not, however, allowed DHS, the FBI, or Ankura to
determine what data the Hacker may have accessed or viewed while connected to the database.
It is possible the Hacker only used access to determine the size of the database and to stage it
for subsequent access that could be sold to others, and that the Hacker did not directly access
any employee data. The security system also has an alert system that is configured to detect
data file transfers that exceed 1GB in size, and no alert was triggered during this security
incident event. However, the Hacker would have had the capability to run queries against the
database and view its data, so we cannot rule out the possibility of unauthorized access or
acquisition.

On April 27, 2017, when parents tried to access their student’s data through the HomeLink Portal, they were able to
view information, as described below, of a student other than their own. The period of time parents and students had
inadvertent exposure to another student’s information was one hour—between 8:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. and the data of
approximately 600 families was exposed. The District has no reason to believe that any personally identifiable student
information was accessed by an unauthorized person; however, it was possible during this brief window. Once the District
learned of the problem, we immediately took HomeLink offline and began working with our Student Information System
provider (“Eagle Soft”) and with Microsoft. Eagle Soft and Microsoft have identified the malfunction as a caching problem that
has now been repaired. Please note that the District is operating HomeLink as intended by Eagle Soft and Microsoft. The error
occurred due to a software malfunction that was outside of the District’s control.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
We were unfortunately the victims of a social engineering scam that allowed an unauthorized party or
parties to access one of our employee’s email accounts and other portions of our network in November
2018. Although our IT support responded immediately by shutting down access to the account, replacing
our entire server and implementing additional security measures, a recent forensic investigation found that
our system was likely compromised. No evidence was found that files from our system were extracted in
the incident. Due to the high percentage of e-file rejections in the tax season, we have engaged a third
party and outside IT and information security consultant to further investigate, evaluate and respond to the
situation. Although data breaches have been commonplace even in the most secure environments, we
regret that this incident has occurred.

On Friday, February 15, 2019, while trying to resolve an email failure with our email host, Suddenlink, I was
directed to a website that gave a phone number to call for immediate assistance. When I called this number, the
technician stated he could certainly help. He requested access to my computer to understand the issue with the
email. After I installed the software necessary to give him remote access to my computer, he pulled up some IP
addresses on my computer screen and stated that this was the reason for the email failure. He then insisted that in
order to fix the problem and prevent viruses from attacking, I would need to allow him to install a program on our
office’s network server. I told him no and that our local computer technician would be contacted to deal with this.
At that point, he stated that only a Microsoft Tech such as himself would be able to do this. This was a red flag as I
thought I was dealing with a Suddenlink technician. At that point, I quickly disconnected my computer from the
internet and from our office network. I then uninstalled the remote access software I had just allowed him to install,
and turned the computer off. This entire interaction lasted less than eight minutes.

Shortly before this year’s tax deadline, we identified some unusual events for certain clients, including
increased communications from the IRS and rejected e-filings. Because of this, we retained an
independent forensic investigation firm to assist in our investigation. Based on their investigation, it

On May 19, 2017, Meepos & Company (“Meepos”) received reports of issues with certain clients’
2016 tax filings. Meepos immediately launched an investigation and has been working diligently, with the assistance of
third party forensic investigators, to determine what caused the issues and whether other clients may be affected. Through
the investigation, Meepos determined that an unauthorized actor or actors gained access to certain parts of Meepos’s
network due to a misconfiguration of our two-factor password authentication and, as a result, may have had access to
personal information for certain Meepos clients in our tax filing system, including documents that may be associated with
our business client tax filings. After discovering the unauthorized access, we immediately worked with our IT
professionals to identify the access point, quarantined the affected system and completed enterprise wide password
changes to better prevent further unauthorized access to our systems. We also immediately contacted the IRS to alert
them of the situation in order to stop the issuance of any fraudulent refunds. The investigation has determined that the
unauthorized actor(s) may have had access to Meepos’s system beginning on February 24, 2017, although the first known
access to tax information and fraudulent filings did not occur until May 2017.

On or about June 29, 2012 we received word from one of our customers that several of their employees had reported unauthorized charges on their credit cards. As you probably know, we are in the business of selling uniforms, apparel and related items. Many of these sales take place through “web stores” that are developed and hosted by a third party vendor on behalf of Mission Linen Supply. Although purchases made through these web stores are considered transactions with Mission Linen Supply, personally identifiable information that was provided by persons who purchased goods through the web stores was stored and maintained by this third party vendor and not by Mission Linen Supply.

In 2016, Morgan Stanley closed two data centers and decommissioned the computer equipment in both locations. As is
customary, we contracted with a vendor to remove the data from the devices. We subsequently learned that certain devices
believed to have been wiped of all information still contained some unencrypted data. Separately, in 2019, Morgan Stanley
disconnected and replaced a computer server in a local branch office. That server had stored information on encrypted disks
that may have included personal information. During a recent inventory, we were unable to locate that device. The
manufacturer subsequently informed us of a software flaw that could have resulted in small amounts of previously deleted
data remaining on the disks in unencrypted form. We have worked with outside technical experts to understand the facts
and any potential risks.

During this four-day period, customers began reporting to Net32 increased incidents of what appeared to be fraudulent charges relating to the credit cards used to make purchases from this vendor. After learning of the anomalous order activity and the increased fraud reports, Net32 suspended the vendor's credentials on September 25, 2018.

confirmed that just a few employee email accounts were subject to unauthorized access from February 7, 2018 until
March 27, 2018 some of which were accessible for much less time. The forensic investigator then reviewed the email
accounts to determine if they contained any personal information. On June 27, 2018, NARS determined the affected
email accounts contained information relating to you. Unfortunately, the forensic investigator was only able to locate
a small percentage of the addresses for the individuals and entities whose information was stored within these emails.
NARS then undertook an extensive search of its internal records and a third-party vendor was retained to locate the
missing addresses. Once these addresses were found, NARS finalized all documents required to move forward with

request to come from the CEO, the payroll department forwarded PDF copies of a number

appeared to belong to NSC’s CEO. Although this “spoofing” episode was identified for
what it was literally moments after the W-2 forms were sent to the hacker, by that point the
forms themselves had already been shared with him or her. At this point we have no
indication that any of the information contained on the W-2 forms that the payroll

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Pie Five Pizza was recently alerted to a potential security incident. Based upon an
extensive forensic investigation, it appears that an unauthorized individual was able to
gain access to and install malicious software designed to capture payment card
information on some of our payment processing systems at a limited number of our
locations. Although we do not store payment card information on our systems, based
on the forensic investigation, it appears that the malicious software was able to
capture card information date in real time as card information as it was being entered
into certain of our systems. To find out if your Pie Five location was impacted, please
visit https://www.piefivepizza.com/paymentcardsecurity/store-list/

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
On November 6, 2020, through Merchant Services’* internal cybersecurity program, we discovered a potential compromise of a website used by part of our U.S. business. We promptly initiated an investigation to determine the nature and potential impact of the vulnerability. In the course of doing so, we identified suspicious activity indicating that an unauthorized actor submitted automated queries to the website. We created a secure environment to test the queries, using available logs and other information to assess potential impact. By November 19, 2020, we determined that a subset of the queries identified might have involved data held on the website. We analyzed logs and other information available to assess whether those queries could have returned information to unauthorized actors, and we engaged external forensics experts to assist. By December 3, 2020, we determined that some queries may have compromised certain information held on the website, although the evidence is not conclusive. At this time, we have identified evidence of suspicious activity on the website between May 13, 2018, and November 24, 2020. We have notified law enforcement.  Although we are not aware of any evidence confirming that the activity resulted in unauthorized actors acquiring or misusing your personal information, we are providing this notice out of an abundance of caution so that you can take steps to protect yourself.

website servers and installed unauthorized software. PAX removed this software on July 15, 2016.
Subsequently, an unauthorized party added similar software on July 22, 2016, which PAX removed that
same day. Our investigation revealed that the unauthorized party accessed personal payment card
information of approximately 6,000 customers who had made purchases from either
www.JUULvapor.com or www.PAXvapor.com between June 25, 2016, and July 22, 2016.

PMI was informed on June 14, 2016, that one of its vendors, Comnet Marketing Group, Inc. (“Comnet”), had been
the victim of an intrusion of its computer systems. An unauthorized user gained administrative access to Comnet’s
systems on April 23-24, 2016, and issued commands to delete all the data housed on Comnet’s servers. That data may
have included certain PMI customer credit card information that Comnet had collected on behalf of PMI. Comnet
did not discover any evidence indicating that the credit card data was accessed or acquired by an unauthorized
user or that the unauthorized user intended to steal data. But Comnet has been unable to definitively rule out any
unauthorized access to or acquisition of data. Thus, PMI provides this notice out of an abundance of caution.

SVH experienced a ransomware cyberattack on October 11, 2020 by what is believed to be a Russian “threat actor.” This event was part of a broader attack on dozens of hospitals across the country. We discovered the attack on that same day and immediately responded by shutting down all systems to contain the damage. We promptly notified law enforcement of the incident and engaged a leading external cybersecurity firm to assess the potential disclosure of protected health information.<br><br>

In a ransomware attack, cybercriminals attempt to disrupt the business by locking companies out of their own data and servers. After discovering the attack, our cyber security team – in partnership with outside information technology and forensics experts – successfully prevented the cybercriminal from blocking our system access and ultimately expelled them from our system. As recommended, SVH did not pay ransom.

On October 27, 2017, the University Privacy Office (“UPO”) received a report that several folders with
confidential information on a shared file server maintained by the Graduate School of Business (“GSB”) were
accessible to GSB faculty, staff and students. The GSB IT team became aware of the incorrect folder permissions
on February 23, 2017, however, because GSB did not appreciate the scope of the exposure there was a delay in
informing the UPO. Following notification, the UPO engaged a third-party forensics team and undertook a
comprehensive review of all the files accessible to the GSB community, and last week discovered a folder with
traveler personal information. The information was collected from students, faculty and staff who were traveling
internationally so that the GSB could provide support for travelers, in particular in the event of medical or other
emergency. Around 2014, there was an organizational change within the GSB traveler program and we believe
that it was during that transition that the folder with personal information of previous travelers was moved to the
shared drive. We do not have any direct evidence that the file containing your personal information was actually
accessed, downloaded or used by any unauthorized person. However, out of an abundance of caution, we believe
that it is important that we notify you so that you can take steps to protect yourself.

Findings from the investigation showed unauthenticated access to files stored in the service, in relatively small amounts, from July 9, 2016 through December 2019, and then a period of concentrated unauthenticated request activity from December 12, 2019 and December 15, 2019. Because we could not identify who made these requests, we reviewed the files associated with the requests to identify the information they contained. On June 30, 2020, we identified that one or more of these files contained some of your information.

customer names, address information, phone numbers, the last four digits of the customer’s credit card number, credit card
expiration date, and gift card information, including account number. They were not able to view full credit card numbers.

government agencies and private-sector organizations for due diligence, threat assessment, identity
authentication, fraud prevention and detection, legislative compliance, and debt recovery purposes.
On January 15, 2013, we discovered potential fraudulent access to our system. The individual accessed
a limited set of information which may have included information about you, including your name,
Social Security number and/or driver’s license number, through what we now believe was a fraudulent
account. There was limited access to information beginning in August of 2012, with the majority of access
through this account occurring in January, 2013. Upon discovering the fraudulent access, we immediately
terminated access and we worked with law enforcement to identify and locate the individual. Law
enforcement asked that we delay our notification to you so as not to interfere with their investigation.
The individual has been arrested and his operation has been shut down. To date, no misuse of information
has been reported to us or, to our knowledge, law enforcement. Law enforcement has lifted its hold
request, which is why we are notifying you at this time.

Following a careful investigation, we concluded that a credential stuffing attack had been launched against our website on October 8 and 9, 2020. A “credential stuffing attack” is a specific type of cybersecurity attack in which the attacker uses account authentication credentials (e.g., email addresses/usernames and passwords) stolen from another source, such as a breach of another company or website, to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. Credential stuffing attacks can occur when individuals use the same authentication credentials on multiple websites, which is why we encourage you to use a unique password on thenorthface.com.<br><br>  

Based on our investigation, we believe that the attacker previously gained access to your email address and password from another source (not from The North Face) and subsequently used those same credentials to access your account on thenorthface.com.<br><br>  

We do not believe that the attacker obtained information from us that would require us to notify you of a data security breach under applicable law, but we are notifying you of the incident voluntarily, out of an abundance of caution.<br><br>

charges had been made on a number of our customers’ credit cards. We have hired forensic
experts, notified law enforcement and we have been working diligently and comprehensively to
investigate the incident, identify how our systems may have been impacted, and secure our
systems. Although our investigation is continuing, we currently believe that some forms of your
data may be affected by the compromise. This information includes encrypted credit or debit
card number, along with card expiration date, name, billing address, email address and, if you
have created a Viator account, the associated email address, encrypted password and Viator
“nickname.” At this time, we have no reason to believe that the three or four digit value printed
at the back or front of your card was compromised. Additionally, debit PIN numbers are not
collected by Viator and could therefore not be compromised.

Sometime between May 26 and June 5, 2020, various groups of individuals broke into multiple Walgreens stores and forced entry into the secured pharmacy at select locations, including your preferred Walgreens. Among the many items stolen were certain items containing health-related information —such as filled prescriptions waiting for customer pick up and paper records. This included a very limited number of hard drives that were attached to stolen cash registers. These hard drives contained information about certain recent pharmacy purchases completed at that cash register. One pharmacy automation device that stored prescription labeling information for a short time period was also involved.  Between May 26 and June 5, Walgreens discovered customer information was impacted. We later determined that one or more of the items described above may have contained your information.

To process its payment card transactions on its websites (westmusic.com and percussionsource.com), West Music
uses a digital commerce platform provided and maintained by a third party vendor named Aptos. On February 6,
2017, we learned from Aptos that it discovered unauthorized access into the portion of the Aptos system containing
payment card information for various Aptos customers, including some West Music customers. Upon learning of
the unauthorized access, Aptos contacted the FBI Cyber Division and the U.S. Department of Justice and engaged
a cybersecurity firm to help contain and eliminate the issue. While investigating, law enforcement requested that
Aptos defer disclosing and discussing the matter with potentially affected retailers (like West Music) and customers
(you) until February 5, 2017 given the active investigation. The investigation determined that malware injected
into the Aptos system may have allowed unauthorized access to certain customer and payment card information
maintained by Aptos. The unauthorized access occurred between February 2016 and December 2016. Based on the
investigation, Aptos informed us that payment card transactions that were made on www.westmusic.com and www.
percussionsource.com were affected by the incident, including both historical card transactions and transactions
made during the period of unauthorized access. This may have affected a transaction you made using a card ending
in [last four numbers of card].

While our investigation remains ongoing, we determined that an unauthorized third party
gained access to Zoosk data stored in a database hosted by a third party on or around
January 12, 2020. The database contained certain information you may have included in
your online Zoosk profile. The majority of this profile information was maintained in the
database in an unreadable format, however, your name, email address, date of birth,
generalized demographical information, gender, and gender search preference may have
been readable in the database. While not confirmed, passwords may also have been
affected. The database did not contain financial or credit card data. Of course, as you
know, we do not collect Social Security numbers, Social Insurance Numbers, driver’s
licenses, passport numbers, or other taxation or government identity information, so none
of these types of information are at issue.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
As you know, Zocdoc allows you to book appointments with doctors who list their medical or dental
practices on our service. Each practice registered with Zocdoc receives usernames which allow staff
members to access Zocdoc’s system (the “Provider Dashboard”) to view appointments and other
information you provide when you book an appointment. In June 2015, we learned of programming errors
in the processes responsible for managing username access to the Provider Dashboard. This allowed some
past or current practice staff members to access the Provider Dashboard, and therefore potentially view
your personal information, after their usernames were removed, deleted or otherwise limited. Access may
have occurred between [first access date] to [last access date]. These practices and their staff members
had obligations regarding the secure and confidential handling of personal information.
